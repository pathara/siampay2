Meanwhile, merchants are suggested to enhance security levels of their web sites to provide maximum protection to their customers. And, via our partner Digi-sign, we are pleased to offer a cost-effective SSL certificate product when needed. &nbsp;<br>

												<p><strong>I'm concerned with the issue of online fraud. What should I do to minimize it?&nbsp;</strong><br>
												Fraudulent behavior online takes various forms from stolen card to system hacking. As an experienced payment service operator, we would like to suggest the following actions to minimize fraud.</p>


												<ul class="bullet2">
													<li><strong>Web site security </strong> - We strongly suggest that SiamPay e-Commerce merchant's e-commerce web site is equipped with security facilities like SSL, encryption and firewall. This way, the merchant's database (especially the sensitive sales information) and its transmission are safe from being accessed by outsiders. </li>
<li><strong>Order details </strong> - Merchants should urge customers to provide adequate information upon ordering, especially contact information of the customers. Make sure that the customer is a legitimate cardholder. More attention is required for suspicious orders (like remote delivery addresses or simultaneous multiple orders). </li>
<li><strong>Free mail address </strong> - Some fraudsters attempt to mask their identity by using a free mail addresses. While most users of free mail addresses are indeed legitimate, caution should be exercised for orders with free mail addresses, especially when this is the only way to contact the customers. </li>
<li><strong>Out-of-norm orders </strong> - Merchants should be wary of orders that falls outside usual ordering patterns, like bulk orders or purchases that greatly exceed the average transaction amount. </li>
<li><strong>IP record</strong>  - Beware of orders made from odd locations (which are sometimes traceable with the IP addresses), especially where credit card fraud is more common. </li>
<li><strong>Proof of delivery</strong>  - Get a signed proof of delivery or receipt if available upon retrieval request. </li>
<li><strong>Return policy</strong>  - Merchants should write and maintain clear, easy to understand and consistent product return policies to keep customers well informed</li>

												<p><span><strong>What is a chargeback?&nbsp;</strong></span> <strong></strong><br>
												A chargeback is the forced reversal of a transaction by the credit card issuing bank. Chargebacks take place when we receive notification from our partner bank that the cardholder's card issuing bank has received a dispute notice from the cardholder, whose card had been charged by our merchants. In certain cases, defense is possible (e.g. order denial while delivery is completed indeed) given merchants are able to provide adequate evidence. In cases of fraudulent card usage, a chargeback is made immediately. Please note that excessive chargebacks may result in service terms revision, service suspension or even termination.</p>

											<h4 class="panel-title">PCI DSS</h4></a>
										</div>


										<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse12">
											<div class="panel-body">
												<p><strong>What is PCI DSS?</strong><br>
												PCI-DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS defines a set of standards to protect card holder’s data throughout the life cycle of a credit card transaction.<br>
												The PCI Security Standards Council offers robust and comprehensive standards and supporting materials to enhance payment card data security. These materials include a framework of specifications, tools, measurements and support resources to help organizations ensure the safe handling of cardholder information at every step. The keystone is the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which provides an actionable framework for developing a robust payment card data security process -- including prevention, detection and appropriate reaction to security incidents.</p>
												<br>
												<br>
												<strong>Who are the parties requiring compliance?</strong><br>
												Any organization that is involved in accepting, processing, transmitting or storing card data must be compliant with PCI DSS. This means that Merchants, Payment Gateways, Network providers and third part service providers must prove their compliance.<br>
												<span><br>
												<strong>What's the purpose of PCI DSS?</strong></span><br>
												The PCI Standard aligns the security requirements and guidelines developed individually by the card schemes into a single standard that protects cardholder identity and transaction information.<br>
												<br>
												<strong>What are the PCI DSS requirements?</strong><br>
												The PCI DSS specifies and elaborates on six major objectives:<br>
												<br>


												<ol style="font-weight:bold;">
													<li><strong>Build and Maintain a Secure Network</strong><br>
													<span style="font-weight:normal;">- Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect data.<br>
													- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.<br>
													First, a secure&nbsp;network&nbsp;must be maintained in which transactions can be conducted. This requirement involves the use of&nbsp;firewalls that are robust enough to be effective without causing undue inconvenience to cardholders or vendors. Specialized firewalls are available for wireless LANs, which are highly vulnerable to eavesdropping and attacks by malicious&nbsp;hackers. In addition,&nbsp;authentication&nbsp;data such as personal identification numbers (PINs) and&nbsp;passwords must not involve defaults supplied by the vendors. Customers should be able to conveniently and frequently change such data.</span><br>
													<br>
													</li>


													<li><strong>Protect Cardholder Data</strong><br>
													<span style="font-weight:normal;">- Protect stored data.<br>
													- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data and sensitive information across public networks.<br>
													Second, cardholder information must be protected wherever it is stored. Repositories with vital data such as dates of birth, mothers' maiden names, Social Security numbers, phone numbers and mailing addresses should be secure against hacking. When cardholder data is transmitted through public networks, that data must be encrypted in an effective way. Digital&nbsp;encryption&nbsp;is important in all forms of credit-card transactions, but particularly in&nbsp;e-commerce&nbsp;conducted on the Internet.</span><br>
													<br>
													</li>


													<li><strong>Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program</strong><br>
													<span style="font-weight:normal;">- Use and regularly update antivirus software.<br>
													- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.<br>
													Third, systems should be protected against the activities of malicious hackers by using frequently updated&nbsp;anti-virus software, anti-spyware&nbsp;programs, and other anti-malware&nbsp;solutions. All&nbsp;applications should be free of&nbsp;bugs and vulnerabilities that might open the door to exploits in which cardholder data could be stolen or altered. Patches offered by&nbsp;software&nbsp;and operating system (OS) vendors should be regularly installed to ensure the highest possible level of vulnerability management.</span><br>
													<br>
													</li>


													<li><strong>Implement Strong Access Control Measures</strong><br>
													<span style="font-weight:normal;">- Restrict access to data by need-to-know.<br>
													- Assign a unique ID to each person with access.<br>
													- Restrict physical access to cardholder data<br>
													Fourth, access to system information and operations should be restricted and controlled. Cardholders should not have to provide information to businesses unless those businesses must know that information to protect themselves and effectively carry out a transaction. Every person who uses a computer in the system must be assigned a unique and confidential identification name or number. Cardholder data should be protected physically as well as electronically. Examples include the use of document shredders, avoidance of unnecessary paper document duplication, and locks and chains on dumpsters to discourage criminals who would otherwise rummage through the trash.</span><br>
													<br>
													</li>


													<li><strong>Regularly Monitor and Test Networks</strong><br>
													<span style="font-weight:normal;">-Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.<br>
													-Regularly test security systems and processes.<br>
													Fifth, networks must be constantly monitored and regularly tested to ensure that all security measures and processes are in place, are functioning properly, and are kept up-do-date. For example, anti-virus and anti-spyware programs should be provided with the latest definitions and signatures. These programs should scan all exchanged data, all applications, all random-access memory (RAM) and all storage&nbsp;media frequently if not continuously.</span><br>
													<br>
													</li>


													<li><strong>Maintain an Information Security Policy</strong><br>
													<span style="font-weight:normal;">-Maintain a policy that addresses information security.<br>
													Sixth, a formal information security policy must be defined, maintained, and followed at all times and by all participating entities. Enforcement measures such as audits and penalties for non-compliance may be necessary.</span>
													</li>
